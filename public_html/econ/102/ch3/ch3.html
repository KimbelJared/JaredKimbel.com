<h2>Concepts</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Market Demand Curve</h3>
<p><img src='ch3/mdc.png'></p>
<br>
<p>Constraint: Prices must be determined by the market.</p>
<p>As supply increases price decreases, as well as demand.</p>
<br>
<h3>Demand Changes</h3>
<p>Shifts in demand curve: Preference Shifts.</p>
<br>
<p>Movement along demand curve:</p>
<br>
<h3>Supply Changes</h3>
<p>Shifts in supply curve: Cost of production, number of sellers, change of production technology.</p>
<br>
<p>Movement along supply curve: Change in quantity supplied as a result of price change.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>An increase in the price of production substitute for a good will cause a decrease in the supply of that good.</p>
<br>
<p>Market equilibrium exists at quantity supplied and quantity demanded are equal.</p>
<br>
<p>To find market demand economists add together the quantities of a good or service that each consumer would buy at each price.</p>
<br>
<p>Prices are used to provide information between buyers and sellers</p>
