<h2>Concepts</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Accounting System</h3>
<p><img src='accSys.png'></p>
<br>
<p>The accounting system’s purpose is to analyze, record, and summarize business activities. It captures the information about the business and financing activities of a company for both internal users<mark>(Financial accounting reports)</mark>and external users<mark>(Managerial accounting reports)</mark>.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Basic Accounting Equation</h3>
<p>Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder’s Equity</p>
<br>
<h3>The Net Income Equation</h3>
<p>Revenues - Expenses = Net Income.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Separate Entity Assumption</h3>
<p>The financial reports of a business are assumed to include the results of only that business’s activities.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Unit of Measure Assumption </h3>
<p>The results of business activities should be reported in an appropriate monetary unit.</p>
<br>
<h2> The Financial Statements</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Who, What, When </h3>
<p>	Who is the report from</p>
<p>	What is the statement </p>
<p>	When the statement covers (point in time or a time period)</p>
<br>
<h3>Uses </h3>
<p><u>Creditors</u></p>
<ul><li>	Is a company generating enough cash (Cash flow)
</li><li>	Does company have enough assets to cover liabilities (Balance sheet)
</li></ul>
<p><u>Investors</u></p>
<ul><li>	What is immediate return on investment (Retained Earnings)
</li><li>	What is the long term return (Income Statement)
</li></ul>
<p><u>Overall</u></p>
<p>Provide useful financial information to external users for decision making. It is useful if  it is relevant and a faithful representation. Other enhancers are being timely, verifiable, comparable, and understandable. These things all lead to standards.</p>
<br>
<h3>Standards</h3>
<p>The USA has the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) that use GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principals).</p>
<br>
<p>The World has IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) that use IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards).</p>
<br>
<h3>The Income Statement </h3>
<p><img src='incState.PNG'></p>
<p>Uses the Net Income Equation, with Revenues first (biggest to smallest) then Expenses (biggest to smallest, income tax is always last), and finally at the bottom is net income.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Statement of Retained Earnings</h3>
<p><img src='stateRE.PNG'></p>
<p>The previous time periods retained earnings are added to the net income (from the income statement), and dividends are subtracted, giving you the new retained earnings amount</p>
<br>
<h3>The Balance Sheet </h3>
<p><img src='balSheet.PNG'></p>
<p>The retained earnings are brought over to the balance sheet, which is a<mark>point in time</mark>of the company. Using the basic accounting equation, Assets are put at the top (sorted by liquidity), followed by Liabilities (short to long term), then Stockholders Equity. The total of SE + L should equal your assets.</p>
<br>
<h3> The Statement of Cash Flows</h3>
<p><img src='stateCF.PNG'></p>
<p>The cash from the balance sheet is brought over as an operating activity. The balance sheet shows the companies activities (all 3) over a specific time period and how that effect the cash of the company.</p>
