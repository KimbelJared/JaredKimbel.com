I've put off writing this for months, telling myself that once I started, everything became real.
That won't change anything, all I will do is forget all the stories, and things I wanted to document.

**Chief Ed**

While on the  base in  Vietnam, they started to come under fire. One of the C-130's would not start and
as he put it, "I was the only one stupid enough to try and fix it". So while
taking fire, he was able  to fix the plane, saving the day with his heroic actions. Chief Ed was awarded a
Bronze Star for his heroic actions.

He was also  just  as much of a hooligan  as  you  would expect. Last  fall while he was in  the hospital,
I would come and hangout with him before work. I would  sit next to him in the bed, hold  his hand, and he
would tell me stories.

Stationed who knows where, him and his  buddies were returning to the hotel that they were staying at, after a
night of drinking. As they got close to the hotel, a car stopped next to them and the driver hopped  out. He was clearly
more intoxicated than the group of airmen, but still asked  them to drive him home. Ed hopped  into the drivers
seat. As they approached the  guys  house, they stopped the car, he hopped out and  waved them off. Realizing they now
had the  car, Ed took it for a joyride. After  driving for a while, they cops  pulled up  behind  them, lights on,
in an  attempt  to  pull  the car over.

Ed  did  not  stop  the car,  simply  driving  fast, eventually  leading to a cornfield  where he jumped  out of  the  car
and  booked  it. Climbing through backyards and ditches  till he found a shed out back of a house, and slept there for the night.

Returning to the hotel in  the morning, he was surprised  by the lack of interest in him. But his fellow  airmen had had
not  turned him in. They claimed someone offered them a ride and they did not realize the car was stolen.
