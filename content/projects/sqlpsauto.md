title: "Automating SQL with Powershell"

There are multiple ways to automate SQL scripts both with and without powershell. But like everything, I was building on some already established system.

Many of the self-service time SQL reports (the ones that I was automating) were stored inside IBM's Cognos. Which after suffering through the training, I came to learn that it was not too great at more complex SQL, or even running particularly fast. So with that in mind, I chose to remove the SQL from the cognos report and write a powershell interface that would execute the queries. The main variables that would change are dates, and locations to query from, all simple enough to do.

**Initial Setup**

 ``` powershell

 ```

 **Another Module**

  ``` powershell

  ```
